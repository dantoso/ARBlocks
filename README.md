# ARBlocks

Hey there, I've created this prototype that serves as an experimental game. The game is an iOS AR experience for building with cubes (similiar to Minecraft). The game detects horizontal surfaces so you can place blocks on top of them, from there you can place blocks adjacent to one another or more on top of the detected plane. You can place blocks with different colors and remove unwanted blocks besides being able to save your creations for later retrieval.
